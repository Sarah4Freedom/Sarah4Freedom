    <!-- SHORT BLURB: WHO SHE IS -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>About Sarah</h2>
      <p>
        Sarah is a former Registered Practical Nurse (RPN) from Ontario, Canada, with over a decade of 
        experience caring for children with disabilities, senior residents in long-term care, and advocating 
        as a union leader. She became a vocal critic of certain COVID-19 policies, believing that lockdowns 
        and mandates were causing more harm than good. After speaking publicly and challenging the official 
        narrative, she faced backlash, lost her nursing positions, and is now in a legal battle to defend 
        her right—and the right of all healthcare professionals—to speak freely.

    <!-- EMERGENCIES ACT CASE -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Emergencies Act Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        In early 2022, Sarah and other members of the group 
        <strong>Canadian Frontline Nurses</strong> joined the peaceful Freedom Convoy protests 
        in Ottawa. Prime Minister Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act, allowing banks to freeze 
        protestors’ accounts without due process. Believing this was an unconstitutional use of 
        power designed to silence lawful dissent, Sarah’s group became one of the first to 
        challenge the invocation in Federal Court. The fight continues on appeal, where Sarah 
        seeks to reaffirm Canadians’ fundamental freedoms and expose the political motives 
        behind the government’s extreme measures.

    <!-- COLLEGE OF NURSES CASE -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>College of Nurses Discipline Case</h2>
      <p>
        The College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) is attempting to discipline Sarah over 
        social media posts and a public speech that questioned public health guidelines. 
        The CNO alleges her information was “false, misleading, or inaccurate.” Sarah argues 
        that her views are backed by research and expert testimony—testimony the College has 
        refused to hear. She is now awaiting the outcome of a lengthy hearing and is prepared 
        to appeal any decision that undermines a nurse’s right to engage in open scientific 
        dialogue and free expression.

        These legal battles are costly and Sarah has lost her primary sources of income. 
        If you believe in the principles of free speech, informed consent, and open 
        scientific inquiry, consider contributing to her legal defense.
