      <h2>About Sarah</h2>
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>
          Sarah Choujonian is a former Registered Practical Nurse (RPN) from Ontario, Canada, 
          with over a decade of experience caring for children with disabilities, senior 
          residents in long-term care, and advocating as a union leader. She became a vocal 
          critic of certain COVID-19 policies, believing that lockdowns and mandates were 
          causing more harm than good. After speaking publicly and challenging the official 
          narrative, she faced backlash and lost her nursing positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sarah founded <strong>Nurses Against Lockdowns</strong>, an advocacy group focused 
          on raising awareness about the detrimental social and psychological effects of 
          restrictive COVID-19 policies. She later co-founded 
          <strong>Canadian Frontline Nurses</strong>, which organized rallies and events 
          supporting healthcare workers opposed to vaccine mandates, and promoted open 
          scientific dialogue on the measures implemented by public health authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sarah is now in a legal battle to defend her right—and the right of all healthcare 
          professionals—to speak freely, promote dialogue and debate, and uphold the principle 
          of informed consent.

        <p>
          In January 2022, Sarah and other members of 
          <strong>Canadian Frontline Nurses</strong> joined the peaceful Freedom 
          Convoy protests in Ottawa. Canadian Frontline Nurses was recognized as a 
          participating group in the Freedom Convoy. When Prime Minister Trudeau 
          invoked the Emergencies Act, it allowed banks to freeze protesters’ accounts 
          without due process—an unprecedented and controversial move. Believing 
          this was an unconstitutional overreach of power designed to silence 
          lawful dissent, Sarah’s group was the first to challenge the invocation 
          in Federal Court. Although the government eventually revoked the emergency 
          declaration, the fight continues on appeal, where Sarah seeks to defend 
          Canadians’ fundamental freedoms and expose the political motivations 
          behind these extreme measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Canadian Frontline Nurses seeks to represent the perspective of the 
          protestors, setting the record straight: they were not “fringe racists” 
          or “terrorists with unacceptable views,” but rather patriotic Canadians 
          from diverse backgrounds who peacefully expressed dissent. Their goal was 
          to encourage the government to end divisive mandates and stop marginalizing 
          Canadians for holding different viewpoints. In court, the government continues 
          to characterize these demonstrators as violent extremists posing a serious 
          threat to national security. Sarah’s legal battle challenges that narrative 
          head-on.

      <div class="cno-content">
        <h2>College of Nurses Discipline Case</h2>
        <p>
          The College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) is attempting to discipline Sarah over a 
          handful of social media posts and a public speech that questioned public health 
          guidelines during COVID-19. The CNO alleges her information was “false, 
          misleading, or inaccurate.” Sarah argues that her views contribute to the 
          social and scientific debate about the measures that were deployed during 
          the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the statements she made or shared are backed 
          by research and expert testimony—testimony the College has refused to hear. 
          She is now awaiting the outcome of a 30-day hearing and is prepared to appeal 
          any decision that undermines a nurse’s right to engage in open scientific 
          dialogue and free expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these challenges, Sarah remains committed to advocating for transparency, 
          informed consent, and robust scientific debate within healthcare. She believes 
          that professionals should not face punishment for respectfully questioning 
          official policies that impact patient care and public health on a large scale.
