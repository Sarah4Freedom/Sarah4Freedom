    <!-- ABOUT SARAH -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>About Sarah</h2>
      <p>
        Sarah Choujonian is a former Registered Practical Nurse (RPN) from Ontario, Canada, 
        with over a decade of experience caring for children with disabilities, senior 
        residents in long-term care, and advocating as a union leader. She became a vocal 
        critic of certain COVID-19 policies, believing that lockdowns and mandates were 
        causing more harm than good. After speaking publicly and challenging the official 
        narrative, she faced backlash, lost her nursing positions, and is now in a legal 
        battle to defend her right—and the right of all healthcare professionals—to speak 
        freely, promote dialogue and debate, and to defend the principle of informed 
        consent.

      <p>
        In January 2022, Sarah and other members of 
        <strong>Canadian Frontline Nurses</strong> joined the peaceful Freedom 
        Convoy protests in Ottawa. Canadian Frontline Nurses was recognized as a 
        participating group in the Freedom Convoy. When Prime Minister Trudeau 
        invoked the Emergencies Act, it allowed banks to freeze protesters’ accounts 
        without due process—an unprecedented and controversial move. Believing 
        this was an unconstitutional overreach of power designed to silence 
        lawful dissent, Sarah’s group was the first to challenge the invocation 
        in Federal Court. Although the government eventually revoked the emergency 
        declaration, the fight continues on appeal, where Sarah seeks to defend 
        Canadians’ fundamental freedoms and expose the political motivations 
        behind these extreme measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Canadian Frontline Nurses seeks to represent the perspective of the 
        protestors, setting the record straight: they were not “fringe racists” 
        or “terrorists with unacceptable views,” but rather patriotic Canadians 
        from diverse backgrounds who peacefully expressed dissent. Their goal was 
        to encourage the government to end divisive mandates and stop marginalizing 
        Canadians for holding different viewpoints. In court, the government continues 
        to characterize these demonstrators as violent extremists posing a serious 
        threat to national security. Sarah’s legal battle challenges that narrative 
        head-on.

    <!-- COLLEGE OF NURSES CASE -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>College of Nurses Discipline Case</h2>
      <p>
        The College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) is attempting to discipline Sarah over a 
        handful of social media posts and a public speech that questioned public health 
        guidelines during COVID-19. The CNO alleges her information was “false, 
        misleading, or inaccurate.” Sarah argues that her views contribute to the 
        social and scientific debate about the measures that were deployed during 
        the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the statements she made or shared are backed 
        by research and expert testimony—testimony the College has refused to hear. 
        She is now awaiting the outcome of a 30-day hearing and is prepared to appeal 
        any decision that undermines a nurse’s right to engage in open scientific 
        dialogue and free expression.
