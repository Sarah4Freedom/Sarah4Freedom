    <!-- SHORT BLURB: WHO SHE IS -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>About Sarah</h2>
      <p>
        Sarah is a former Registered Practical Nurse (RPN) from Ontario, Canada, with over a decade of 
        experience caring for children with disabilities, senior residents in long-term care, and advocating 
        as a union leader. She became a vocal critic of certain COVID-19 policies, believing that lockdowns 
        and mandates were causing more harm than good. After speaking publicly and challenging the official 
        narrative, she faced backlash, lost her nursing positions, and is now in a legal battle to defend 
        her right—and the right of all healthcare professionals—to speak freely, promote dialogue and debate, and to defend the principle of informed consent

          <p>
            In January 2022, Sarah and other members of 
            <strong>Canadian Frontline Nurses</strong> joined the peaceful Freedom 
            Convoy protests in Ottawa. Canadian Frontline Nurses was recognized as a participating group in the Freedom Convoy.  When Prime Minister Trudeau invoked the 
            Emergencies Act, it allowed banks to freeze protesters’ accounts 
            without due process—an unprecedented and controversial move. Believing 
            this was an unconstitutional overreach of power designed to silence 
            lawful dissent, Sarah’s group was the first to challenge the 
            invocation in Federal Court. Although the government eventually 
            revoked the emergency declaration, the fight continues on appeal, 
            where Sarah seeks to defend Canadians’ fundamental freedoms and 
            expose the political motivations behind these extreme measures. Canadian Frontline Nurses seeks to represent the perspective of the protestors. Sarah and her group wish to set the record straight: the protestors were not fringe racists extremists and terrorists with unacceptable views as the government labelled them, but patriotic Canadians from different backgrounds who love this country and its values and sought to peacefully express their dissent with a view to encouraging the government to end the divisiveness of COVID-19 mandates and restrictions, and the divisiveness caused by slurring groups of Canadians whose views and agenda did not agree with Trudeau's. The government is seeking to silence that voice in court and characterize these patriotic Canadians as ideologically motivated violent extremists who posed a serious threat to the national security of Canada.

    <!-- COLLEGE OF NURSES CASE -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>College of Nurses Discipline Case</h2>
      <p>
        The College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) is attempting to discipline Sarah over a handful of
        social media posts and a public speech that questioned public health guidelines during COVID-19. 
        The CNO alleges her information was “false, misleading, or inaccurate.” Sarah 
        argues that her views contribute to the social and scientific debate about the measures that were deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the statements she made or shared are backed by research and expert testimony—testimony 
        the College has refused to hear. She is now awaiting the outcome of a lengthy 
        (30 day) hearing and is prepared to appeal any decision that undermines a nurse’s right 
        to engage in open scientific dialogue and free expression.
